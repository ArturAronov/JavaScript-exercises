## Collection of JavaScript Recursion I've created or found online
   
### Why?  
I've been struggling with recursions and the concept of it for months now. Also there seems to be a somehwat of a lack of examples on line of JavaScript recursions that make sense. Hence I've decided to collect and convert as many loops as I possibly could into recursions to get better understanding for them.
