Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
ie: 
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5 etc.

I've created a function with parameter n (ie, if n = 5, the function will iterate the loop for 5 times), that is esentially a stopping condition for loop that will iterate inside the function.
Since we know that fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, I've declared two variables (num1 & num2) to store value of 0 and 1.
num3 variable is empty, however it will will be used down the line to store the sum of num1 and num2.

For the second step, I've created for loop with the stopping condition of n to find the value of num3 by adding num1 with num2. If the result of num3 is even number, the if statement with modulo operator will push it to empty array called result.

Third step is to move second digit (num2) into the first (num1) position, and the num3 (sum of num1 + num2) move to second digit (num2). Now when the loop returns to starting point and starts to re-iterate again, we have updated digits to find new Fibonacci sequence.
